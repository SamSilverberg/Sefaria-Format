      "\n",
      "Who hears the voice of His servant?\n",
      "\n",
      "Though he walks in darkness and has no light, let him trust in the name of the Lord, and rely upon his God” (Isaiah 50:10).\n",
      "\n",
      "In other words, God asks, who among you fears the Lord yet did not come to hear the voice of His servant the prayer leader, who engages in the service of God?\n",
      "\n",
      "He who went out before dawn and walks in darkness before prayer.\n",
      "\n",
      "If it is for a matter involving a mitzva that he went and absented himself from prayer in the synagogue, then, despite the darkness, there is light for him, the aura of his mitzva will protect him.\n",
      "\n",
      "But if it is for an optional matter, some mundane purpose, that he went and absented himself from prayer in the synagogue, then, even once the day begins, there is no light for him (Maharsha).\n",
      "\n",
      "The verse continues: “Let him trust in the name of the Lord.\n",
      "\n",
      "” The Gemara asks: What is the reason that God is so exacting with this person?\n",
      "\n",
      "The Gemara answers: Because he should have relied on the name of the Lord, and trusted that he would not incur any loss if he postponed dealing with his mundane matters until after prayer in the synagogue, and he did not rely on God.\n",
      "\n",
      "On this same topic, \u001b[1mRabbi Yoḥanan\u001b[0m said: When the Holy One, Blessed be He, enters a synagogue and does not find ten people there, He immediately becomes angry, as it is stated: “Why, when I came, was there no one?\n",

      "Concerning another aspect of the constancy of prayer, Rabbi Ḥelbo said that \u001b[1mRav Huna\u001b[0m said: One who sets a fixed place for his prayer, the God of Abraham assists him.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since prayer parallels the Temple service, it is a sign of respect to set a fixed place for this sacred rite (\u001b[1mRabbi Yoshiyahu\u001b[0m Pinto).\n",

      "The God of Abraham assists him because this pious custom evokes Abraham’s conduct.\n",

      "\n",
      "” Presumably, one who sets a fixed place for prayer is a disciple of Abraham in every respect, including humility and piety (\u001b[1mRabbi Yoshiyahu\u001b[0m Pinto).\n",
      "\n",
      "The Gemara asks: From where do we derive that Abraham our father set a fixed place for his prayer?\n",
      "\n",
      "The Gemara answers: As it is written: “And Abraham rose in the morning to the place where he had stood before God” (Genesis 19:27), and the verb “standing” means nothing other than prayer, as it is stated: “And Pinehas stood and prayed” (Psalms 106:30).\n",
      "\n",
      "Rabbi Ḥelbo said that \u001b[1mRav Huna\u001b[0m said: One who leaves the synagogue should not take large strides because it creates the impression that he is eager to leave.\n",
      "\n",
      "Abaye explained \u001b[1mRav Huna\u001b[0m’s statement and said: This halakha was only said with regard to leaving the synagogue, where large strides seem particularly disrespectful.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, with regard to entering a synagogue, it is a mitzva to run and one is permitted to rush and take large strides (\u001b[1mRabbi Yoshiyahu\u001b[0m Pinto).\n",

      "\n",
      "One is prohibited from running on Shabbat in deference to the sanctity of the day.\n",
      "\n",
      "Once I heard that which \u001b[1mRabbi Tanḥum\u001b[0m said that \u001b[1mRabbi Yehoshua\u001b[0m ben Levi said: One should always run for a matter of halakha, even on Shabbat, as it is stated: “They shall walk after the Lord, who will roar like a lion” (Hosea 11:10).\n",

      "In other words, one should rush as though he were chased by a lion (Birkat Hashem), I too run.\n",

      "\u001b[1mRabbi Zeira\u001b[0m said: The reward for attending the lecture is for running.\n",

      "\n",
      "Similarly, Abaye said: The reward for attending the kalla is for the crowding.\n",
      "\n",
      "Due to the large crowd, study was difficult, so the primary reward was given for their effort to hear and understand some part of the lecture.\n",
      "\n",
      "Similarly, \u001b[1mRava said\u001b[0m: The reward for learning the halakhic traditions of the amora’im is for the logical analysis, as the primary reward for studying Talmud was not given for knowing the halakhic conclusions, but for the logical reasoning that led to those conclusions.\n",
      "\n",
      "\u001b[1mRav Pappa\u001b[0m said: The primary reward for attending a house of mourning [bei tammaya] is for the silence, which is the optimal manner for those consoling the mourners to express their empathy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mar Zutra said: The primary reward for fasting is for the charity given to the poor on the fast day (see Isaiah 58).\n",
      "\n",
      "\u001b[1mRav Sheshet\u001b[0m said: The primary reward for delivering a eulogy is for causing those in attendance to raise their voices and cry, as that increases the grief over the deceased.\n",

      ", the good wishes with which the guests regale the bride and groom.\n",
      "\n",
      "Back to the topic of deference for a synagogue, the Gemara records that \u001b[1mRav Huna\u001b[0m said: One who prays behind the synagogue is called wicked, as while the entire congregation is facing one direction to pray, he faces the opposite direction creating the impression that he is treating the synagogue and its congregation with contempt.\n",
      "\n",
      "As it is stated: “The wicked walk round about, when vileness is exalted among the sons of men” (Psalms 12:9).\n",
      "\n",
      "In other words, only the wicked walk round about the synagogue in order to pray.\n",
      "\n",
      "Abaye said: This halakha was said only in a case where one does not turn his face toward the synagogue.\n",
      "\n",
      "But where he turns his face toward the synagogue and prays we have no prohibition in that case.\n",
      "\n",
      "To reinforce the gravity of this prohibition, the Gemara relates: A certain individual prayed behind the synagogue and did not turn to face the synagogue.\n",

      "\u001b[1mRav Huna\u001b[0m already explained the beginning of the verse, “The wicked walk round about.\n",

      "\n",
      "” One of the Sages said to Rav Beivai bar Abaye, and some say Rav Beivai said to \u001b[1mRav Naḥman\u001b[0m bar Yitzḥak: What is the meaning of: “When vileness is exalted among the sons of men”?\n",
      "\n",

      "\u001b[1mRabbi Yoḥanan\u001b[0m and his student, \u001b[1mRabbi Elazar\u001b[0m, both said an alternative explanation of this verse: Once a person needs the help of others and loses dignity in their eyes, vileness among the sons of men, his face changes and becomes like a kerum, as it is stated: “When [kerum] vileness is exalted among the sons of men.\n",
      "\n",

      "\u001b[1mRabbi Ami\u001b[0m and \u001b[1mRabbi Asi\u001b[0m both said: One who becomes dependent upon others, it is as if he was punished with two punishments: Fire and water.\n",
      "\n",
      "As it is stated: “You have caused men to ride over our heads; we have gone through fire and water” (Psalms 66:12).\n",
      "\n",
      "And Rabbi Ḥelbo said that \u001b[1mRav Huna\u001b[0m said: One must always be vigilant with regard to the afternoon prayer, as Elijah’s prayer was only answered in the afternoon prayer, as it is stated: “And it was at the time of the afternoon offering that Elijah the Prophet came near, and he said: Lord, God of Abraham, Isaac and Israel, let it be known on this day that You are God in Israel, and that I am Your servant, and that I have done all these things at Your word.\n",
      "\n",
      "Answer me, Lord, answer me, that this people will know that You, Lord, are God” (I Kings 18:36–37).\n",
      "\n",
      "Because Elijah was answered in the afternoon prayer, it has particular significance.\n",
      "\n",
      "In passing, the Gemara explains why it was necessary for Elijah to repeat, “answer me, Lord, answer me”: The first answer me was the request that fire descend from the heavens, while the second answer me was the request that Israel should accept complete faith in God and not say that the fire descending from the heavens was an act of sorcery.\n",
      "\n",
      "\u001b[1mRabbi Yoḥanan\u001b[0m said: One must be vigilant with regard to the evening prayer as well, as it is stated: “Let my prayer come forth as incense before You, the lifting of my hands as the evening offering” (Psalms 141:2).\n",
      "\n",
      "\u001b[1mRav Naḥman\u001b[0m bar Yitzḥak said: One must be vigilant with regard to the morning prayer as well, as it is stated: “Lord, in the morning You shall hear my voice; in the morning I will order my prayer unto You and will look forward” (Psalms 5:4).\n",
      "\n",
      "And Rabbi Ḥelbo said that \u001b[1mRav Huna\u001b[0m said: Anyone who benefits from the feast of a groom but does not cause him to rejoice violates the five voices mentioned in this verse, as it is stated: “The voice of joy and the voice of gladness, the voice of the groom and the voice of the bride, and the voice of those who say: Give thanks to the Lord of hosts, for the Lord is good, for His mercy lasts forever, even of those who bring a thanks-offering to the house of the Lord.\n",

      "For I will restore the captivity of the land as it was in the beginning, says the Lord” (Jeremiah 33:11).\n",
      "\n",
      "These five voices in the context of a bride and groom correspond to the five voices mentioned in the context of the revelation at Sinai, as in Song of Songs, the day of the revelation at Sinai is alluded to by the phrase: His wedding day (\u001b[1mRabbi Yoshiyahu\u001b[0m Pinto, Maharsha).\n",

      "\n",
      "\u001b[1mRabbi Yehoshua\u001b[0m ben Levi said: He is privileged to acquire the Torah, which was given with five voices, as it is stated: “And it was on the third day, when it was morning, there were sounds [kolot], and lightning and a thick cloud upon the mountain, and the voice of the shofar ” (Exodus 19:16).\n",
      "\n",
      "The plural kolot indicates at least two sounds, while “the voice of the shofar” is one more.\n",
      "\n",
      "The passage continues: “And when the voice of the shofar grew louder and louder, Moses spoke and God answered him by a voice” (Exodus 19:19).\n",
      "\n",
      "Along with the three previous voices, the second shofar and the voice with which God answered Moses amount to a total of five voices at the revelation at Sinai.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Gemara asks: Is this so?\n",
      "\n",
      "Isn’t it also written: “And the whole nation saw the voices and the torches and the sound of the shofar” (Exodus 20:15)?\n",
      "\n",
      "Clearly more than five voices are mentioned with regard to the revelation at Sinai.\n",
